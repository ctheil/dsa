# DSA

Here lies my personal notes, implementations and practice on various data-structures and algorithms.

Assuming everything below is completed, each contains `README.md` (my notes on the subject), my practice implementation from scratch `imp.ts`, a test file `imp.test.ts`, and an exaple file `example.ts`, where I copy an implementation from a trusted source.
